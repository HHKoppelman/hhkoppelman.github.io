                      I am interested in a wide range of topics but I aim to focus my attention at the Milky Way, and specifically its halo.
                      In one line of my research, I study the formation history and evolution of the Galaxy. To this end, I use statistics and machine learning algorithms to identify and analyse structures and substructures in the stellar halo.
                      Another reseach interest of mine is to probe the nature and distribution of dark matter as traced by the stars in the Milky Way.
                      Feel free to contact me for any (remotely) overlapping project! I have (some) experience with simulations, data analysis, theory, machine learning, and visualization techniques for large data sets.

                      <b>FORMATION HISTORY OF THE NEARBY STELLAR HALO.</b> The main focus of my research is to study the formation history of the stellar halo using astrometric data from Gaia (Gaia&nbsp;Collaboration et al., 2018, 2016) combined with spectroscopic data. On April 25th 2018, with the second data release of Gaia (DR2), the most extensive catalogue comprising full phase-space information became available. My preparation for this catalogue culminated in Koppelman et al. (2018) – submitted five days after DR2 – where I used simple analysis techniques to isolate and study halo stars within 1 kpc from the Sun. I found several small structures reminiscent of accreted dwarf galaxies or globular clusters. Contrary to expectation, most of the halo is dominated by a large blob of stars. This blob is kinematically similar to a classical halo with close to zero rotation. Besides this blob, I have shown that there is another significant component in the stellar halo that appears to be an extension of the thick disk (see also Di&nbsp;Matteo et al., 2018; Haywood et al., 2018) this component is also referred to as the in situ halo (c.f. Bonaca et al., 2017; Gallart et al., 2019).

                    <p>
                      <b>THE DISCOVERY OF GAIA-ENCELADUS.</b> Shortly after its discovery, we selected and studied the stars that make up the ‘blob’ in the halo. Inspired by comparison to the N-body simulations of Villalobos and Helmi (2008), we set out to show that these stars formed in a single massive dwarf galaxy that we labelled Gaia-Enceladus. We found evidence for this claim in the colour-(absolute-)magnitude diagram of the member stars and in the sequence that they describe in chemical abundance space (Helmi et al., 2018). Accrding to our analysis, Gaia-Enceladus was a massive dwarf galaxy of with a stellar mass of 10^8.5 − 10^9.5 solar masses that merged with Milky Way about 10 Gyr ago. This dwarf galaxy was the last massive merger of the Milky Way and heated (in parts) the stars in the thick disk. I contributed significantly to the selection of the members, the dynamical analysis, and the comparison of data and simulations in this study.

                    <p>
                      <b>SIGNS OF MANY MORE DISRUPTED DWARFS.</b> Similarly, by combining various kinds of survey data, I studied the origin of the Helmi streams (Koppelman et al., 2019b). By comparing to <nobr>N-body</nobr> simulations, I estimated that the streams originate in a single dwarf galaxy that had a stellar mass of roughly 10^8 solar masses. Based on the dynamical footprint of the best fitting simulation of this stream, I identified seven globular clusters that likely were accreted together with this dwarf galaxy.
                      Most recently, I have shown that there are signs of several disrupted dwarf galaxies in the retrograde halo Koppelman et al. (2019a). Besides Gaia-Enceladus, in the high-energy part of the retrograde halo, there is the debris of the Sequoia (Myeong et al., 2019). However, I have shown that the stars in the low-energy, retrograde halo are chemically distinct. The stars making up this structure are rich in Mg and are on disky retrograde motions. I have labelled this structure Thamnos.

                    <p>
                      <b>GLOBULAR CLUSTERS AS TRACERS OF FORMATION HISTORY.</b> Not only stars but also a significant part of the globular cluster population of the Milky Way is thought to be accreted (e.g. Forbes and Bridges, 2010). In Massari et al. (2019) we identified groups of globular clusters that were likely accreted together based on their dynamics and the age-metallicity relation. A closed-box chemical evolution model that depends on the mass of the hosting dwarf galaxy does a surprisingly good job in predicting the age-metallicity relation of a population globular clusters (e.g. Leaman et al., 2013). We associated globular clusters to several know accretion events and found a new group of globular clusters at low binding energy that could not be identified with a known accretion event. This group possibly hints at the evidence of another massive merger that happened before Gaia-Enceladus (see also Kruijssen et al., 2019). I contributed significantly to the dynamical analysis, catalogue assembly, and cluster classification of this publication.
